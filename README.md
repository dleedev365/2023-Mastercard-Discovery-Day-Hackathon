#### Technologies used
- Mastercard's in-house Rule AI Engine for training Natural Language Processing models
- Figma for wireframing (due to many constraints including time, the team couldn't launch the project to Apple's App Store)

#### Result
At the end of the day, my team attracked most attention of judges, however, our project didn't win the prize due to monetary limitations. Through this experience, I learned about iOS-specific  plugin development environment and different teams within the organization.
